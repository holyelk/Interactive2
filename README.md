# Interactive2
Interactive 2 module with remakes of interactive art pieces  

RM1 consists of a interactive mirror which gets darker as people go closer to it. The mirror is a live video stream from user's webcam.  

RM2 consists of a webcam that uses blob detection to draw on the wall.   
blobtraced_laser.py is without background extractor but still works.   
blobtraced_laser_Cleaned .py is the cleaned code with background extractor.
